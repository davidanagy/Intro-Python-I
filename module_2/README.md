# Module 2 Directory

This directory contains files relevant to the second module (day) in the "Introduction to Python" sprint. It contains the following files:

## Class Notes

[class_practice.py](https://github.com/davidanagy/Intro-Python-I/blob/david-nagy/module_2/class_practice.py) and [rps_in_class.py](https://github.com/davidanagy/Intro-Python-I/blob/david-nagy/module_2/rps_in_class.py) are files I wrote during the lecture, (mostly) copying the code that the lecturer displayed.

## Project Files

[dining_philosophers_problem.md](https://github.com/davidanagy/Intro-Python-I/blob/david-nagy/module_2/dining_philosophers_problem.md) contains my proposed solution to the "Dining Philosophers Problem."

[rps_assignment.py](https://github.com/davidanagy/Intro-Python-I/blob/david-nagy/module_2/rps_assignment.py) contains my work on the second aspect of this module's guided project, the RPS game. I copied over (with minimal changes) the code as it appeared in the instructions, added the requested functionality, and described my process of adding that functionality in the doc-string at the end. ([history.txt](https://github.com/davidanagy/Intro-Python-I/blob/david-nagy/module_2/history.txt) is used in this file.) It should be possible to run in-terminal by typing `python rps_assignment.py`.
